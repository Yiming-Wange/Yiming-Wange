#### Opensource Projects
During my early deep learning journey, Stanford's CS231n and CS224n courses were immensely helpful. To consolidate what I learned and support fellow learners, I developed a set of open-source tutorial projects and blog postsâ€”feel free to explore them if you're starting out in computer vision or NLP.
