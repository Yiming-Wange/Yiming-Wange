### Hi there üëã
**Driven by the question ‚ÄúHow can machines accelerate scientific discovery?‚Äù**, I am currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science & AI at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/data-science-and-ai-msc/)

At Chalmers, I build deep-generative models that design proteins and engineer enzymes, translating abstract representations into tangible life-science advances.

**Industry**: As an AI Innovation Center intern at [**Midea Group**](https://www.midea.com/global/), I fine-tuned large-language-model pipelines that power smart-home assistants, reducing latency by 28% and boosting NLU accuracy to 93%.

**Research**: Under [**Prof. Stan Z. Li**](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/stan-zq-li.html) at [**AI Lab**][https://github.com/Westlake-AI], [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), I explored topic on AI and Life Science such as TCR-Peptide interative modeling, Cell Metabolic Modeling, Protein Mutation-to-fitness Prediction. 

**Interests**
- **Deep representation learning** & OOD generalization  
- Generative models for biology and chemistry
- GNN-driven scientific reasoning

**Looking ahead**, I hope to collaborate with labs and R&D teams that turn algorithmic breakthroughs into real-world therapeutics and green-tech solutions.

#### Opensource Projects
During my early deep learning journey, Stanford's CS231n and CS224n courses were immensely helpful. To consolidate what I learned and support fellow learners, I developed a set of open-source tutorial projects and blog posts‚Äîfeel free to explore them if you're starting out in computer vision or NLP.
